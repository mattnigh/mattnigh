### 👋 Hi there, I'm Matt

I am an Engineering Business Manager @ GitHub. 

My expertise is building, leading, and maturing software development groups. I thrive in an environment in which I can manage a mix of complex strategic, technical, and people problems. Said simply - I love being a part of creating meaningful impact across technical organizations. 

I am Autistic - and was diagnosed as an adult. I write/speak about engineering leadership, my experiences with Autism, and delivering software.
