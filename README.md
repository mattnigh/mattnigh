### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Matt.

I am an Engineering Business Manager @ GitHub. 

My expertise is building, leading, and maturing software development groups. I thrive in an environment in which I can manage a mix of complex strategic, technical, and people problems. Said simply - I love being a part of creating meaningful impact across entire organizations.
