### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Matt.

I am an Technical Business Operations Manager @ GitHub. I am responsible for running business operations and am the acting Chief of Staff for a SVP of Engineering and the GitHub Platform and Enterprise organization (~ 600 engineers). 

You can visit my portfolio at [mattnigh.net](https://www.mattnigh.net/) and my blog at [blog.mattnigh.net](https://blog.mattnigh.net/).

### What I do

My expertise is building, leading, and maturing software development organizations. I thrive in an environment in which I can manage a mix of complex strategic, technical, and people problems. Said simply - I love being a part of creating meaningful impact across entire organizations.
